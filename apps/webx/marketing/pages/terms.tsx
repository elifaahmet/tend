          does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect
          to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if
          known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the
          debtor." If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any
          comparable statute or doctrine. This Indemnity and Release will
          survive termination of these Terms.

          <strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.</strong> This Dispute Resolution by
          Binding Arbitration Section is referred to in these Terms as the
          "Arbitration Agreement." You agree that any and all disputes or claims
          that have arisen or may arise between you and TEND, whether arising
          out of or relating to these Terms (including any alleged breach), our
          Services, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship, or
          transactions between us, will be resolved exclusively through final
          and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the
          terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert
          individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. This
          Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to
          the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies
          can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You
          agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and TEND are each
          waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class
          action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not by
          a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the
          interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          PROHIBITION OF CLASS AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND NON-INDIVIDUALIZED
          RELIEF. YOU AND TEND AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST
          THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
          MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
          UNLESS BOTH YOU AND TEND AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT
          CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY
          NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE,
          OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING
          MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE
          INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO
          PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS.
        </p>
        <p>
          PRE-ARBITRATION DISPUTE RESOLUTION. TEND is always interested in
          resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most user concerns
          can be resolved quickly and to the user's satisfaction by emailing
          customer support at hey@tend.money. If such efforts prove
          unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send
          to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("
          <strong>Notice</strong>").The Notice to TEND should be sent to 6701
          Broadway Extension, Suite 310, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73116 ("
          <strong>Notice Address</strong>"). The Notice must (i) describe the
          nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the
          specific relief sought. If TEND and you do not resolve the claim
          within 60 days after the Notice is received, you or TEND may commence
          an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any
          settlement offer made by TEND or you will not be disclosed to the
          arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any,
          to which you are or TEND is entitled.
        </p>
        <p>
          ARBITRATION PROCEDURES. Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral
          arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's
          ("<strong>AAA</strong>") rules and procedures, including the AAA's
          Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively,
          the "<strong>AAA Rules</strong>"), as modified by this Arbitration
          Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website,
          https://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for
          consumer disputes can be found at the AAA's consumer arbitration page,
          https://www.adr.org/Consumer.If there is any inconsistency between any
          term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the
          terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control, unless the
          arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent
          Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair
          arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these
          Terms as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide,
          including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and
          arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration
          proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and
          other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages
          and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an
          individual under these Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the
          arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court
          only for very limited reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless TEND and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will
          take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with
          due consideration of each's ability to travel and other pertinent
          circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the
          determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or
          less, TEND agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be
          conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
          arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing,
          as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the
          right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of
          the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will
          issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
          findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
        </p>
        <p>
          COSTS OF ARBITRATION. Payment of all filing, administration, and
          arbitrator fees (collectively, the "Arbitration Fees") will be
          governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this
          Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or
          less, at your request, TEND will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the
          value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to
          demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay
          your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise
          determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your
          portion of the Arbitration Fees, TEND will pay your portion of such
          fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs
          of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of
          litigation, TEND will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the
          arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
          cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys' fees will be governed by
          the AAA Rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          CONFIDENTIALITY. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any
          ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator will be strictly
          confidential for the benefit of all parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          SEVERABILITY. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or
          provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the Section titled
          "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
          Non-Individualized Relief" above) is invalid or unenforceable, the
          parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or
          provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
          expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
          provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so
          modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the
          provisions of Section above titled "Prohibition of Class and
          Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" are invalid or
          unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be
          null and void. The remainder of these Terms will continue to apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          FUTURE CHANGES TO ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. Notwithstanding any provision
          in these Terms to the contrary, TEND agrees that if it makes any
          future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to
          the Notice Address) while you are a user of our Services, you may
          reject any such change by sending TEND written notice within 30 days
          of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any
          future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute
          between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration
          Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or the
          effective date of any subsequent changes to these Terms).

        </p>
        <p>
          You cannot combine the following items with a Qualifying Purchase,

          <strong>Cash Back Caps and Limitations</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Some offers may have Cash Back earning maximums or other limitations
          that may restrict Your ability to earn Cash Back on any particular
          offer with any particular Participating Merchant
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a Participating Merchant may cap Your Cash Back rewards
          on any transaction, require a minimum purchase amount, or may also
          limit the number of transactions that qualify for the program.

        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition, some offers from Participating Merchants may only allow
          You to earn Cash Back for online purchases. In these cases, you will
          only earn Cash Back for purchases You make through the designated
          merchant website having followed the appropriate links through the
          TEND App.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cash Back from a Participating Merchant is not available in connection
          with:

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to Earn</strong> Cash Back
        </p>
        <p>
          You may earn Cash Back when You make Qualifying Purchases either
          online or in¬-store.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a Qualifying Purchase to be valid, you must make a purchase
          through an applicable Online or In¬-Store Offer. Any additional terms
          and conditions will be disclosed to you at the time you select the
          Online or In-¬Store Offer through the TEND App.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Online Offers</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          To complete a Qualifying Purchase online through a Participating
          Merchant, you must arrive at the Participating Merchant's website
          through the appropriate link in the TEND app. This is the only way
          eligible purchases can be tracked and Cash Back awarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>In-Store Offer</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          To complete a Qualifying Purchase through an In-Store Offer, you must
          meet any terms and conditions required to receive Cash Back. You learn
          these terms when you receive the offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must make Qualifying Purchases either in person at a Participating
          Merchant or by personally using the TEND App. You cannot create spend
          activity by using any of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Automatic programs</li>
          <li>Scripts</li>
          <li>Any other form of electronic or other assistance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Activated Qualifying Purchases</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          All Qualifying Purchases require You to use Your Debit Card to make
          the purchase and may also require You to activate (turn-on) the offer.
          In these cases, you must click the activate button in the TEND app to
          use the offer. You will receive the offer's expiration date when you
          activate it. You must follow these directions for activated Qualifying
          Purchases in order to make them eligible for Cash Back.
        </p>
        <p>
          When using Your Debit Card for these transactions, the offers earn
          Cash Back on the eligible goods' or services' net purchase price. In
          other words, We base Your cash-back on the net amount You actually
          paid.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cash Back Calculations</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Net Purchases:</strong> You can only earn Cash Back on Your
            net purchases (purchases minus returns/credits).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bonus Rewards Reversals:</strong> We may reverse any Cash
            Back for the appearance of fraud or abuse.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Additional Charges:</strong> We may not consider taxes,
            fees, and shipping/handling charges as part of a Qualifying
            Purchase. These expenses may not earn Cash Back.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Participating Merchants:</strong> The amount of Cash Back
            offered and the amount you can earn varies by Participating
            Merchant.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>When You Receive Cash Back</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You will not immediately receive the Cash Back you earn on a
          Qualifying Purchase. Participating Merchants can have the following
          timeframe(s) to process Cash Back.
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>Your Action</td>
            <td>Merchant Posting Timeframes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Qualifying Purchase</td>
            <td>
              Up to 90 days after making purchase and for travel purchases
              (flight, hotel, rental car, etc.) up to 90 days after the travel
              occurred.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          Please note Participating Merchants' policies vary for how frequently
          they report transactions. As a result, some Cash Back earned for
          Qualifying Purchases may take longer than others to appear in Your
          TEND Savings Account.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Returns</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You will not receive Cash Back for returns of purchases. Cash Back
          generated from Qualifying Purchases which are later returned will,
          depending on the date of return, not be credited to Your account or
          will be subject to an automatic debit of the Cash Back amount from
          your Savings account if the credit has already occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Account Closure</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You will forfeit all Cash Back that has not processed and been paid
          into Your TEND account at the time of closure of Your account.

            days of the end of the Review Period.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide the necessary documentation concerning the purchase You
            believe should have resulted in Cash Back, specifically:
            <ol>
              <li>Your Name</li>
              <li>Merchant Name</li>

          <strong>Dispute Resolution / Arbitration</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          This section ("Arbitration Provision") constitutes the arbitration
          agreement between You and Us and includes a mutual waiver of class
          action rights. This Arbitration Provision governs disputes concerning
          (1) interpretation of these Terms (including this Arbitration
          Provision and whether a disagreement is a "dispute" subject to binding
          arbitration as provided for in this Arbitration Provision); (2) the
          Program; or (3) the Program's related services or matters
          (collectively and each a "Covered Dispute(s)").

            <strong>Non-judicial resolution of disputes</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You and We agree that any Covered Dispute between or among You and Us,
          regardless of when it arose, will, upon demand by either You or Us, be
          resolved by the following arbitration process. You understand and
          agree that You and We are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a
          trial before a judge in a public court. As an exception to this
          Arbitration Provision, both You and We retain the right to pursue in
          small claims court in the state where You reside any dispute that is
          within that court's jurisdiction.

            <strong>Definition of disputes</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A dispute is any unresolved disagreement between or among You and Us.
          It includes claims based on broken promises or contracts, torts
          (injuries caused by negligent or intentional conduct) or other
          wrongful actions. It also includes statutory, common law, and
          equitable claims. A dispute also includes any disagreement about the
          meaning of this Arbitration Provision, and whether a disagreement is a
          "dispute" subject to binding arbitration as provided for in this
          Arbitration Provision.

              Binding arbitration; waiver of class action rights; severability
            </strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Binding arbitration is a means of having an independent third party
          resolve a Covered Dispute without using the court system, judges, or
          juries. Either You or We may require the submission of a Covered
          Dispute to binding arbitration at any reasonable time notwithstanding
          that a lawsuit or other proceeding has been commenced. If either You
          or We fail to submit to binding arbitration following a lawful demand,
          the one who fails to so submit bears all costs and expenses (including
          attorney's fees and expenses) incurred by the other in compelling
          arbitration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither You nor We will be entitled to join or consolidate Covered
          Disputes by or against others in any arbitration, or to include in any
          arbitration any Covered Dispute as a representative or member of a
          class, or to act in any arbitration in the interest of the general
          public or in a private attorney general capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each arbitration, including the selection of the arbitrator will be
          administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), or such
          other administrator as You and We may mutually agree to (the AAA or
          such other mutually agreeable administrator to be referred to
          hereinafter as the "Arbitration Administrator"), according to the
          Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplemental Procedures for
          Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Rules"). To the extent that there is
          any variance between the AAA Rules and this Arbitration Provision,
          this Arbitration Provision will control. Arbitrator(s) must be a
          member of the state bar where the arbitration is held, with expertise
          in the substantive laws applicable to the subject matter of the
          Covered Dispute.
        </p>
        <p>
          You and We each agree that in this relationship (1) You and We are
          participating in transactions involving interstate commerce; (2) The
          arbitrator shall decide any dispute regarding the enforceability of
          this Arbitration Provision; and (3) Each arbitration is governed by
          the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United
          States Code), and, to the extent any provision of that Act is
          inapplicable, unenforceable or invalid, the laws of the state of
          Oklahoma.

          class action, class arbitration, private attorney general action,
          other representative action, joinder, or consolidation is found to be
          unlawful or unenforceable, that invalid provision shall not be

          You and We each agree to take all steps and execute all documents
          necessary for the implementation of arbitration proceedings. The
          arbitrator may hear and rule on appropriate dispositive motions as
          part of the arbitration proceeding, such as motions for judgments on
          the pleadings, summary judgment, or partial summary judgment. The AAA,
          the arbitrators, You and We, must, to the extent feasible, take any
          necessary action to ensure that an arbitration proceeding, as
          described in this Arbitration Provision, is completed within 180 days
          of filing the Covered Dispute with the AAA. These parties must not
          disclose the existence, content, or results of the arbitration, except
          for disclosures of information required in the ordinary course of
          business or permitted by applicable law or regulation. This provision
          will be liberally construed in order to ensure the enforcement of this
          Arbitration Provision. Arbitration proceedings are conducted in the
          state where You reside or at a location determined by the AAA.

        <p>
          All statutes of limitations applicable to any Covered Dispute apply to
          any arbitration between You and Us. The provisions of this Arbitration
          Provision will survive termination, amendment, or expiration of Your
          participation in the Program or any other relationship between You and
          Us. This Arbitration Provision constitutes the entire agreement
          between You and Us related to arbitration of a Covered Dispute and

          dispute resolution.

          check with the Arbitration Administrator to determine the fees
          applicable to any arbitration You may file. If the law applicable to
          this Agreement limits the amount of fees and expenses to be paid by
          You, then no allocation of fees and expenses to You shall exceed this
          limitation. Unless inconsistent with applicable law, each of Us shall
          bear the expense of our own attorney, expert and witness fees,

            Bonus Rewards. From time to time, RetailMeNot may oﬀer a Bonus
            Reward to certain RetailMeNot members who complete a qualifying
            activity or who meet certain criteria, as deﬁned in a Rewards Oﬀer
            Card or Promotion Landing Page, in addition to or in combination
            with oﬀers for Online Cash Back Rewards or In-Store Cash Back
            Rewards. For example, RetailMeNot may oﬀer a "My First Time" Bonus
            Reward to new members who earn an Online Cash Back Reward for the
            ﬁrst time or earn certain Online Cash Back Rewards for the ﬁrst
            time. In order to earn a Bonus Reward, you must satisfy all criteria
            set forth for earning the Bonus Reward as well as the requirements
            of these Promotion Terms during the promotion period for the Bonus
            Reward. RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust the
            promotion period and/or the bonus amount for Bonus Reward, at any
            time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are ﬁnal and
            binding on you. Bonus Rewards are a limited time oﬀers and all
            criteria must be satisﬁed within the dates of the Promotion.

            Returns, Approvals, and No Ownership.
            <p>
              For any Rewards Oﬀer, if you return or exchange the items
              purchased, complete your purchase before or after the Promotion
              Period, initiate a purchase that results in a chargeback, or fail
              to satisfy a Minimum Purchase Amount, or any other conditions
              speciﬁed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards Oﬀer Card,
              RetailMeNot reserves the right to invalidate or withdraw all or
              part of the Rewards Oﬀer. The determination of whether or not a
              purchase qualiﬁes for the Rewards Oﬀer and whether applicable
              conditions have been satisﬁed is at the sole discretion of
              RetailMeNot. In the event of a dispute, you may be required to
              provide your order conﬁrmation as proof of purchase. The timing of
              when RetailMeNot will issue an Approved Reward will vary based on
              a number of factors. These factors may include the type of
              Promotion pursuant to which a Reward is oﬀered and your account
              activity as a member of RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the
              right, in its sole discretion, to determine the order and timing
              in which to process its conﬁrmation of eligible purchases. Rewards
              may be limited where participation exceeds the Total Rewards Oﬀers
              available during Promotion or in other cases, as determined by
              RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. RetailMeNot also reserves the
              right, in its sole discretion, to reevaluate Approved Rewards, at
              any time, without notice, including, but not limited to, whether
              purchases qualify for the Promotion and whether applicable
              conditions have been satisﬁed, and RetailMeNot, in its sole
              discretion, may adjust or withdraw any Rewards Oﬀers or any
              Approved Rewards, at any time, without notice. All decisions by
              RetailMeNot are ﬁnal and binding on you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participating in a Rewards Oﬀer does not give you ownership or any
              other legal claim to any Reward unless and until RetailMeNot, in
              its sole discretion, determines that you have met all eligibility
              criteria and fulﬁlled all requirements for the Promotion and you
              have completed the Redemption Process. Rewards Oﬀers are provided
              solely by RetailMeNot and are not underwritten or funded by any
              other third party. You may not make any claims for Rewards Oﬀers
              against Merchants or any other third party. Notwithstanding that
              Rewards Oﬀers may include oﬀers of cash, prior to redemption,
              Rewards Oﬀers and Approved Rewards have no monetary value and you
              may not obtain any money or any other thing of value for any
              Approved Reward or participation in any Rewards Oﬀer unless and
              until you complete the Redemption Process and a payment has been
              issued by RetailMeNot for Approved Rewards.

            Abuse and Cancellations.
            <p>
              RetailMeNot reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify
              the Promotion, or any part of it, or the payment of any Rewards
              amounts at any time without obligation or notice to you,
              including, without limitation, if any fraud, technical failures,
              limit of available Rewards, gaming, human error or any other
              factor impairs the integrity, availability or proper functioning
              of the Promotion, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole
              discretion. Without limiting anything in these Promotion Terms or
              the Terms of Use, RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole
              discretion, to disqualify, terminate or suspend the participation
              in any Promotion, or otherwise prevent future participation, of
              any individual it ﬁnds, or reasonably suspects, to be tampering
              with the operation of a Promotion (including by submitting or
              attempting to submit fraudulent or ineligible Receipts) or to be
              acting in violation of the Promotion Terms or any promotion, or in
              behaving in an unethical, dishonest, deceptive or disruptive
              manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the
              legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of
              criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made,
              RetailMeNot reserves the right to seek damages from any such
              person to the fullest extent permitted by law. RetailMeNot’s
              failure to enforce any term of these Promotion Terms shall not
              constitute a waiver of that provision. RetailMeNot shall not be
              liable to you for any suspension, modiﬁcation or termination of a
              Rewards Oﬀer or the Promotion program.

              Use of any automated means or more than one account is prohibited
              and will result in disqualiﬁcation. In the event of any dispute as
              to the qualiﬁcation of potential recipients of a Reward, the
              authorized account holder of the email address or phone number
              provided to RetailMeNot at the time the account was created will
              be deemed the qualiﬁed Reward recipient. The "authorized account
              holder" is the natural person assigned an email address by an
              Internet access provider, online service provider or other
              organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the
              domain associated with the submitted address. Each potential
              recipient of Rewards may be required to show proof of being an
              authorized account holder.
