        "answer": "The other guys will nickel and dime you with hidden charges and fees, or hound you to upgrade. At Tend, we’re transparent. The monthly fee gets you access to all of the essential banking services you need, as well as awesome reward programs that just aren’t available elsewhere. By spending a little to join, you can earn and save a lot in return. Not too bad for about the same cost as a medium pizza each month."

        "name": "How do I earn money with Tend Shares?",
        "topic": "Some Topic",
        "answer": "It's simple. As soon as someone opens a Tend account at your invitation (which we call a “Share”), you are eligible to receive Tend Shares payments each month, as long as their account remains active. The more “Shares” you have, the bigger your portion of Tend Shares each month. Tend Shares payments are made automatically. Additionally, after their membership has been active for 3 months, every one of your invitees who joins Tend earns you a free month along with a credit towards an additional bonus. Ka-ching.\n\nOnce you’ve reached 12 bonus credits, we’ll also put $50 (500 pesos) into your Savings. Make it 24, and we’ll make it another $100 (1000 pesos)! 36 gets you $150 (1500 pesos), and so on."
