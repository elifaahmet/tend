      "Once upon a time, the great Biggie Smalls said, “Mo Money, Mo Problems.”",
      "But when we look around and see people earning and saving less than their parents, plus an ever-increasing number of unexpected bank fees…and unequal access to credit…and a lack of financial education in schools…it’s clear that not having money comes with its fair share of problems too.",
      "We all work hard for our money. Nobody should worry about getting their money to work hard for them.",
      "That’s why we started Tend - to empower everyone to create happier, financially healthy lives.",
      "Because it doesn’t matter if you’re hustling to find your financial footing, or just looking for a personal finance experience designed for real people – we believe you deserve a money partner who you can trust and grow with.",
      "And that when more people can tend to their money, things tend to get better for more people."
